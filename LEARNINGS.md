# Learnings

Auto-generated by nightly compound review. Read by Claude Code at session start.

### Gotchas
- Supabase Security Advisor warnings must be addressed promptly — LLM-generated code often has RLS gaps
- Google Search Console "page with redirect" issues need redirect chain cleanup for proper indexing

## 2026-02-02

### Patterns
- Voice note limits split into short (<2min) and full (>2min) categories to enable generous free-tier micro-reflections while gating expensive long transcriptions behind Pro
- Email template functions must be registered in the sender's template map — having the React component alone isn't enough
- Feature flags in subscription config (structured_reflection, communication_analysis, etc.) give fine-grained tier control without code changes

### Gotchas
- Onboarding email cron failed with "Unknown template" because social-proof, first-value, feature-highlight, and last-chance components existed but weren't wired into the email sender's dispatch map
- `cannot change return type of existing function` in Supabase — must DROP and recreate the function rather than ALTER when return type changes
- Admin console had broken joins and N+1 queries that only surfaced under real data — test admin pages with populated databases

### Decisions
- Three-tier pricing (Free / Pro / Pro Plus) with voice notes as the key differentiator between tiers
- Short voice notes (under 2 min) unlimited on Pro, full session recordings (60-90 min) on Pro Plus only due to transcription costs
- Voice analysis for coaching quality (communication patterns, development blocks, CPD export) positioned as Pro Plus features
- New feature branch created to protect current user testing while building voice analysis features

### Patterns
- Mobile scroll jank fix: use a single scroll container (h-[100dvh] flex-col overflow-hidden) with header/nav as shrink-0 overlays — never nest competing scrollable regions
- Consistent AI markdown formatting requires explicit system prompt instructions enforcing bold headings and bullet lists as a minimum baseline
- Visual warmth in AI chat: warm colour palette (amber/stone accents), emoji selectors, and trailing question prompts make the experience feel less robotic

### Gotchas
- Trailing AI questions ("Would you like me to continue?") blend into the answer body — visually separating them with a divider and accent styling makes the next step obvious
- Chat input padding on mobile wastes significant screen real estate — compact single-row textarea with tighter padding reclaims usable space

## 2026-02-04

### Patterns
- Capacitor 8 uses Swift Package Manager (SPM) instead of CocoaPods — Codemagic build scripts must skip workspace/pod steps and build the .xcodeproj directly
- RevenueCat setup requires three layers: entitlements (access level), products (App Store/Play Store items), and offerings (what users see) — configure entitlements first, then products, then wire into offerings
- Chunked transcription for large audio files: split recordings into segments to stay within API limits for 90+ minute coaching session recordings
- Mobile app submission checklist: delete-account URL, privacy policy URL, data safety declarations, and subscription descriptions must all be live before store review

### Gotchas
- iOS bundle ID mismatch between Capacitor config and Codemagic signing causes build failures — hardcode the bundle ID in both places and verify they match (`com.coachreflection.app` not `com.coachreflect.app`)
- Codemagic auto-increment build number must be configured explicitly — iOS rejects duplicate build numbers on resubmission. Use `agvtool new-version -all $((${PROJECT_BUILD_NUMBER} + 1))` in codemagic.yaml
- Google Play requires a service account credentials JSON for RevenueCat server-side receipt validation — this is separate from the Play Console login
- App Store "404 on URL" rejection: the delete-account and privacy policy pages must be deployed and publicly accessible before submission, not just committed to the repo
- Provisioning profile must be manually created at developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles if Codemagic `--create` flag doesn't auto-generate it
- DEVELOPMENT_TEAM (22F5XZJVF6) must be set in project.pbxproj for both Debug and Release build configurations — without it, Codemagic signing fails
- Default Capacitor app icon is a blue X placeholder — must replace AppIcon-512@2x.png (1024x1024, no alpha) before submission
- NativeHidden component MUST use useEffect pattern (not render-path check) to avoid React hydration mismatches on iOS WKWebView — lesson from FootballGPT Sentry errors
- Whisper API 25MB file limit means 90+ min session recordings silently fail transcription — chunked transcription with ffmpeg-static splits into 10-min segments
- Coach tester feedback: "nothing saved" when using voice note — likely mic permission denied or navigated away before clicking Stop Recording

### Decisions
- CoachReflection mobile apps set up via Capacitor + Codemagic + RevenueCat — same stack as FootballGPT for consistency
- Four email parity features added to match FootballGPT standard: abandoned checkout recovery, streak-at-risk reminder, winback day-7 final email, Resend webhook tracking
- Pro and Pro Plus subscriptions configured in RevenueCat with matching entitlements for cross-platform subscription management
- Full session recording upload (record on phone, upload to app) is the recommended path for 90+ min recordings — in-app recording not viable for long sessions due to browser/WebView constraints
- App Store listing positioned as multi-sport (not just football) to broaden addressable market

## 2026-02-05

### Patterns
- Cross-product SEO batch: llms.txt, AI keyword meta tags, custom 404 pages, and blog internal links can be templated and rolled out across all products in one session
- Topic pages (e.g. /topics/rugby, /topics/cricket) create SEO landing pages for each sport vertical without needing unique content per page — auto-generated from blog tag taxonomy
- App Store In-App Purchase configuration must be completed before submission even if the app uses Stripe for web — Apple requires IAP metadata to be present for review

### Gotchas
- App Store review requires at least one screenshot per device size AND app previews are separate from screenshots — "5 of 10 Screenshots" means 5 uploaded across two device sizes, not 5 of a required 10
- App Store Connect subscription setup can fail silently with "changes could not be saved" — retry later rather than re-creating, as the backend is eventually consistent
- Multi-sport positioning requires careful language audit — initial App Store copy was too football-focused despite the app supporting all sports

### Decisions
- CoachReflection submitted to App Store review — first submission with CR brand icon, multi-sport positioning, and IAP subscriptions configured
- SEO overhaul: added robots.ts, expanded sitemap, created /topics taxonomy pages, and added llms.txt for AI crawler discovery
- Blog posts now include internal links section ("Explore CoachReflection") to improve crawl depth and reduce bounce rate

## Video 1: Introduction to CoachReflection

**Title:** `The Post-Session Thoughts You Keep Losing (and How to Fix It)`

**Alt titles:**
- `Why I Started Writing Down My Coaching Thoughts`

**Description:**
```
You finish a session. Your mind is racing. That drill worked. One player seemed off. The game fell apart at the end. By the time you get home, those thoughts are gone.

Every coach has this experience. We think deeply about our sessions but we don't capture the insights. We don't build on them. We don't learn from them systematically.

What's in the video:
00:00 The problem every coach has
00:00 What structured reflection actually looks like
00:00 The five guided questions
00:00 How pattern detection works
00:00 Session plan upload and voice notes
00:00 Mood and energy tracking
00:00 Who this is for
00:00 How to get started (free)

Works for any sport, any level. Football, rugby, basketball, hockey, tennis, cricket, and more.

## Video 3: Why Reflection Makes Better Coaches

**Title:** `The 2-Minute Habit That Made Me a Better Coach`

**Alt titles:**
- `Why the Best Coaches Reflect (and the Busiest Don't)`
- `Reflection vs Thinking: Why Writing It Down Changes Everything`

**Description:**
```
The best coaches reflect. The busiest coaches don't. And the coaches who most need to improve are often the ones with the least time to think about improving.

This video explains why reflection works. Not just that it works, but the mechanism behind it. Because understanding the why might convince you to make space for it.

What's in the video:
00:00 What happens without reflection
00:00 What happens with reflection
00:00 Why writing it down matters (the science)
00:00 Pattern recognition and why memory fails
00:00 Emotional regulation for coaches
00:00 The accountability loop
00:00 Common objections answered
00:00 What reflecting coaches gain over time
00:00 How to start (with or without an app)

This isn't a product pitch. A notebook works. But understanding why reflection matters will change how you approach your own coaching development.

Or just use a notebook. The key is consistency:
- What worked?
- What didn't?
- What will I focus on next time?

## Video 4: Spotting Burnout Before It Hits

**Title:** `Coach Burnout: How to Spot It Before It's Too Late`

**Alt titles:**
- `The Warning Signs Every Coach Should Track`
- `I Nearly Quit Coaching. Here's What I Missed.`

**Description:**
```
Burnout doesn't announce itself. It creeps up. Session by session. Week by week. Until one day you're dreading something you used to love.

At grassroots level, burnout is epidemic. Coaches are volunteers or barely compensated. They're fitting coaching around jobs and families. Most don't notice burnout until it's too late.

But burnout has warning signs. If you track the right things, you can spot it weeks before it becomes a crisis. This video shows you how.

What's in the video:
00:00 What burnout actually is (3 components)
00:00 Why coaches don't notice it
00:00 Mood and energy tracking explained
00:00 The 5 early warning signs
00:00 What to do when warning signs appear
00:00 A real coaching burnout story
00:00 Practical advice for sustainability
00:00 How to start tracking (free)

The three components of burnout:
1. Emotional exhaustion (drained by coaching)
2. Depersonalisation (cynical and detached)
3. Reduced accomplishment (nothing seems to matter)

When all three are present, most coaches quit. But these build up over weeks. Track your mood and energy after every session and you'll see the decline before it becomes a crisis.

Mood and energy tracking is on the free tier:

## Video 5: Tracking Player Development with AI

**Title:** `How I Track 20 Players' Development (Without Spreadsheets)`

**Alt titles:**
- `Player Development Tracking for Grassroots Coaches`
- `Track Every Player's Progress Just by Reflecting on Sessions`

**Description:**
```
How many players do you coach? Fifteen? Twenty? Now think about each one individually. What are they working on? What have they improved at this season?

Professional academies have analysts, data systems, and performance coaches tracking every player. Grassroots coaches have their memory. Which is incomplete, biased, and forgets more than it remembers.

This video shows how CoachReflection's player tracking builds a picture of every player's development just from your post-session reflections. No extra work. No spreadsheets.

What's in the video:
00:00 The tracking gap between academies and grassroots
00:00 How player mention tracking works
00:00 Live example: building a player profile over time
00:00 Using tracking for individual development plans
00:00 Balancing attention across your squad
00:00 Better parent conversations with data
00:00 End of season reports made easy
00:00 Tips for effective tracking
00:00 What this is and isn't
00:00 How to get started

When you reflect on sessions, you naturally mention players. "Jake had a great session." "Emma seemed withdrawn." CoachReflection tracks these mentions over time, categorises them, and shows you patterns.

After a few weeks you can see: which players appear most in your reflections? What's the balance of positive to concern mentions? Which players are you accidentally overlooking?

5 TIPS FOR BETTER TRACKING
1. Be consistent with player names
2. Mention the quiet ones deliberately
3. Include context with concerns
4. Note unexpected observations
5. Review tracking data monthly

## Notes on Algorithm Alignment

**Niche cluster:** Coaching development and grassroots coaching. These compete with coach education content, CPD videos, and coaching tips channels. Not AI or tech tutorials.

**Title strategy:** Every title leads with the coaching problem or outcome. "CoachReflection" as a product name only appears once in titles (Video 2, the walkthrough, where people are searching for it specifically). The rest hook on coaching pain points.

**Satisfaction per impression:**
- Video 1: "I'll understand what this tool does and whether it's for me"
- Video 2: "I'll know exactly how to use it properly"
- Video 3: "I'll understand why reflection matters and start doing it"
- Video 4: "I'll know how to spot burnout before it's too late"
- Video 5: "I'll track my players' development without extra work"

**Video length expectations:** Coach education YouTube tends towards 10-20 minutes. These scripts are substantial and should land in that range. Don't cut them short to hit an arbitrary target.

**Description structure:** Same template as AI Football Skool videos:
1. Problem/hook (2-3 lines)
2. What's in the video (timestamps)
3. Key content summary
4. Free resource / product link
5. Community links
6. Social links
7. Hashtags

**Hashtags:** Coaching development terms dominate. #coachburnout, #coachdevelopment, #grassrootsfootball, #playerdevelopment. Product hashtag #coachreflection included but not leading.

**Recommended upload order:**
1. Video 3 first (Why Reflection Makes Better Coaches) — broadest appeal, TAM content, doesn't require product knowledge
2. Video 4 second (Burnout) — emotional hook, high shareability, standalone value
3. Video 1 third (Introduction) — now they're interested, show them the tool
4. Video 2 fourth (Walkthrough) — for people who've signed up
5. Video 5 fifth (Player Tracking) — specific feature deep dive

This order maximises early satisfaction signals. The first two videos deliver value regardless of whether the viewer uses CoachReflection. That builds trust before the product-focused content.

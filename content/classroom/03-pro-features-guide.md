## Voice Notes (Pro & Pro+)

Record your reflections instead of typing them.

### How it works:

1. After a session, tap the **microphone icon** in the Reflect tab
2. Record up to **5 minutes** of voice reflection
3. The AI transcribes your recording automatically
4. Your voice reflection is processed like a typed reflection

### Best practices:

**Reflect on the drive home.** Keep your eyes on the road, your thoughts on the session. Voice notes make this safe.

**Talk through the five questions.** Even without seeing them, think: What worked? What didn't? Who stood out? What needs work? What's next?

**Don't worry about polish.** The AI handles natural speech. Ums and pauses are fine.

**Keep it focused.** You have 5 minutes, but 2-3 minutes is usually enough. Quality over quantity.

### Limits:

- Pro: 4 voice notes per month
- Pro+: 12 voice notes per month

Use voice notes for your most important or time-pressed sessions.

## Session Plan Upload (Pro & Pro+)

Link your planned session to your reflection.

### How it works:

1. Before or after your session, tap **Upload Session Plan**
2. Take a photo of your handwritten plan, or upload a digital file (PDF, image)
3. The AI uses vision technology to extract:
   - Objectives
   - Drills/activities
   - Timing
   - Coaching points
   - Equipment

4. Your reflection questions can reference what you planned

### Why this matters:

The gap between what you planned and what actually happened is where learning lives.

With session plan upload, you can reflect on:
- Did I stick to the plan?
- What caused me to deviate?
- Was the planned timing realistic?
- Did the objectives get met?

### Tips for good uploads:

**Clear photos.** Good lighting, flat surface, whole plan visible.

**Readable handwriting.** The AI is good but not magic. If you can read it, the AI probably can.

**Digital files work well.** If you plan digitally, upload the file directly.

## Syllabus Upload (Pro+ only)

Make Coach Reflection understand your coaching philosophy.

### How it works:

1. Go to Settings > Syllabus
2. Upload your club's coaching syllabus, your coaching philosophy document, or both
3. The AI reads and learns your framework
4. Future reflections are analysed through the lens of your philosophy

### What to upload:

- Club coaching syllabus
- Your personal coaching philosophy statement
- Age-appropriate development frameworks
- Playing style documents
- Any document that defines how you coach

### Why this matters:

Generic reflection is useful. Reflection aligned to your philosophy is powerful.

If your syllabus says U12s should focus on 1v1 skills, the AI can spot when your reflections consistently miss this area.

If your philosophy emphasises player enjoyment, the AI can track whether enjoyment-related observations appear in your reflections.

The AI becomes personalised to your coaching approach.

## Full Analytics History (Pro & Pro+)

See patterns across your entire coaching journey.

### What you get:

- Mood and energy trends over months, not just weeks
- Long-term player development tracking
- Seasonal patterns (do you always struggle in winter?)
- Year-over-year comparison

### Why it matters:

Real patterns emerge over time. A few weeks of data shows surface-level trends. Months of data shows what's really happening.

You can trace your development as a coach. See how far you've come. Identify stubborn challenges that persist.

## CPD Documentation (Pro & Pro+)

Export your reflections as Continuing Professional Development evidence.

### How it works:

1. Go to Analytics > Export CPD
2. Select a date range
3. Choose format (PDF or CSV)
4. Download your documentation

### What's included:

- Session dates and types
- Key themes from each reflection
- Development areas identified
- Progress summaries

### Why it matters:

Many clubs and federations require CPD evidence. Instead of creating documentation separately, your reflections automatically become your CPD record.

No extra work. Your development practice is your documentation.

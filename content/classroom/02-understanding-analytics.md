# Understanding Your Analytics

Coach Reflection's analytics turn your reflections into actionable insights. This guide explains what each section means and how to use it.

---

## Accessing Analytics

Click the **Analytics** tab in your dashboard. Select a time period: 4 weeks, 8 weeks, or 12 weeks.

**Note:** You need at least 4 reflections for meaningful analytics. The more reflections, the more accurate the patterns.

---

## Mood & Energy Trends

This graph shows your mood and energy ratings over time.

### What to look for:

**Stable or rising trend:** Healthy. You're managing your coaching load well.

**Declining trend:** Warning sign. Something is draining you. Review what's changed.

**Spiky pattern:** Variable. Consider what causes the peaks and troughs.

**Gap between mood and energy:**
- High mood, low energy = You love coaching but you're physically exhausted. Consider rest.
- Low mood, high energy = Something specific is bothering you. Identify and address it.
- Low mood AND low energy = Burnout danger zone. Take action.

### What to do with this data:

1. Review monthly — Is the trend up, down, or stable?
2. Identify triggers — What sessions coincide with low ratings?
3. Set a threshold — If average drops below 3 for 4 weeks, take action
4. Discuss with someone — Share patterns with a trusted fellow coach

## Recurring Themes

The AI identifies themes that appear repeatedly in your reflections.

### Common themes:

- **Tactical:** Formation, positioning, shape, pressing, transitions
- **Technical:** Passing, receiving, shooting, dribbling, defending technique
- **Physical:** Fitness, speed, strength, endurance, fatigue
- **Mental:** Confidence, focus, communication, attitude
- **Organisational:** Timing, equipment, pitch, weather, logistics
- **Behaviour:** Discipline, listening, focus, respect
- **Parent-related:** Communication, sideline behaviour, expectations

### What to do with themes:

If a theme appears repeatedly as a **problem**, it's not a one-off. It needs systematic attention.

If a theme appears repeatedly as a **positive**, that's working. Consider why and how to maintain it.

## Player Mentions

This shows which players appear most in your reflections and in what context.

### The data shows:

- **Frequency:** How often you mention each player
- **Context:** Positive, concern, or neutral mentions
- **Associated themes:** What topics come up with each player

### What to look for:

**Players never mentioned:** Are you overlooking them? Quiet, competent players often fade into the background.

**Players mentioned only as concerns:** This is valuable information. They need targeted development.

**Balance of attention:** Are you focusing too much on certain players?

### What to do with player data:

1. Review the under-mentioned players — Do they need more attention?
2. For repeated concerns — Create specific development plans
3. For consistent positives — Acknowledge progress, consider new challenges
4. Use for parent conversations — Evidence-based discussion
5. Use for end-of-season reports — Development history at your fingertips

---

## Improvement Trends

The AI identifies areas where you've stopped mentioning problems.

### Example:

You used to mention "running out of time" frequently. You haven't mentioned it in 6 weeks. That's improvement — your session timing has gotten better.

### What this tells you:

You're developing as a coach, even if you don't feel it. Improvement is often invisible in the moment but clear in the data.

---

## Decline Trends

The AI identifies areas where concerns are increasing.

### Example:

"Player behaviour" mentions have increased from 1 per month to 4 per month. Something is changing that needs attention.

### What to do:

Don't panic. Investigate. Has something changed in the team? Is there a particular trigger? Address the root cause.

---

## AI Suggestions

Based on your patterns, the AI offers personalised recommendations.

### Examples:

- "Consider checking in with [Player] individually. They've appeared as a concern in your last 4 reflections."
- "Your energy ratings have declined. Consider a lighter approach next week."
- "You've mentioned 'time management' as a positive recently. Keep doing what's working."

### How to use suggestions:

Take them as prompts, not commands. The AI sees patterns but doesn't know your full context. Use suggestions as starting points for your own reflection.

---

## Time Period Selection

**4 weeks:** Good for recent patterns. High sensitivity to changes. Best for tactical adjustments.

**8 weeks:** Balanced view. Enough data for patterns, recent enough to act on.

**12 weeks:** Big picture view. Shows longer-term trends. Best for development review.

**Recommendation:** Use 8 weeks for regular review. Use 12 weeks for monthly deep-dives.

---

## Free vs Pro Analytics

**Free tier:** 1 week of history. Limited pattern detection.

**Pro tier:** Full history. Complete analytics. All patterns visible.

If you're serious about using analytics for development, Pro is worth it. The full history is where the real insights emerge.

---

## Tips for Using Analytics

1. **Review monthly, not daily** — Analytics need time to accumulate
2. **Look for patterns, not individual data points** — One low mood doesn't matter; a trend does
3. **Act on what you find** — Analytics without action is just data
4. **Connect analytics to planning** — Use insights to guide future sessions
5. **Share with trusted peers** — Another perspective helps interpret patterns

## Common Questions

**How many reflections do I need before analytics are useful?**

At least 4 for basic patterns. 10+ for reliable trends. 20+ for comprehensive insights.

**Why don't my analytics show what I expected?**

Analytics show what you write, not what you think. Be specific in reflections to get useful analytics.

**Can I export my analytics?**

Pro users can export CPD documentation. Full data export available on request.

Your reflections are your coaching development data. Analytics help you see patterns you'd otherwise miss. Use them to guide your improvement.

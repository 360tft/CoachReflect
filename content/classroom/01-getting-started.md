# Getting Started with CoachReflection

Welcome to CoachReflection. This guide will help you get the most out of structured reflection for your coaching development.

## What is CoachReflection?

CoachReflection is an AI-powered coaching journal that helps you:

- **Capture post-session insights** before they fade from memory
- **Track patterns** across weeks and months of coaching
- **Monitor player development** through your observations
- **Spot burnout early** with mood and energy tracking
- **Build a record** of your coaching journey

The core activity is simple: after each session, answer five guided questions. This takes 2-3 minutes but compounds into real development over time.

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Complete Your Profile

Tell us about your coaching:
- Your sport
- Age group you coach
- Coaching level (grassroots, development, academy, etc.)

This helps the AI give you relevant insights.

### Step 2: After Your Next Session, Reflect

Open CoachReflection and answer the five questions:

1. **What worked well today?**
2. **What didn't go as planned?**
3. **Were there any player standouts?** (positive or needs support)
4. **What areas need more work?**
5. **What will you focus on next session?**

Then rate your mood (1-5) and energy (1-5).

### Step 3: Repeat

Do this after every session. Consistency is key. One reflection is data. Fifty reflections reveal patterns.

## The Five Questions Explained

### What worked well today?

Be specific. Not "passing drill" but "The triangle passing drill worked better than last week. Players understood the movement pattern quickly."

This captures your wins. The things to repeat. The moments that clicked.

### What didn't go as planned?

Honest observation, not self-criticism. "The 4v4 game fell apart because teams were unbalanced. I should have reshuffled earlier."

This captures learning opportunities. What to adjust next time.

### Were there any player standouts?

Mention specific players by name. Both positive moments and concerns.

"Jake was brilliant today — first time he's really used his weak foot consistently. Emma seemed withdrawn, third time this month."

Over time, the AI tracks these mentions and shows you player development patterns.

### What areas need more work?

What should you focus on in future sessions based on today's observations?

"Receiving under pressure still needs work. They're comfortable on the ball but panic when closed down."

### What will you focus on next session?

This creates accountability. When you reflect on your next session, you'll see what you committed to.

## Mood and Energy Tracking

After the five questions, rate two things:

**Mood (1-5):** How do you feel after this session? Gut reaction.

**Energy (1-5):** How's your energy level?

These ratings seem simple but they're powerful over time. If your average energy drops from 4 to 2 over six weeks, that's a burnout warning sign. CoachReflection spots it before you feel it.

## What Happens After You Submit

The AI analyses your reflection in a few seconds. It extracts:

- **Themes** (tactical, technical, behaviour, etc.)
- **Player mentions** (with positive/concern/neutral context)
- **Sentiment** (overall tone of your reflection)

This feeds into your analytics, building a picture of your coaching patterns over time.

---

## Building the Habit

CoachReflection only works with consistency. Here's how to build the habit:

1. **Reflect immediately** — Right after the session, while it's fresh
2. **Keep it brief** — 2-3 minutes is enough
3. **Set a reminder** — Phone notification 30 minutes after your usual session time
4. **Track your streak** — Try to maintain consecutive sessions
5. **Don't skip bad sessions** — Those are often the most valuable to reflect on

---

## Next Steps

- **After 4+ reflections:** Check your Analytics tab to see emerging patterns
- **After 2 weeks:** Review your player mentions — who appears most?
- **After 1 month:** Do a deeper analytics review — what themes keep appearing?
- **Consider Pro:** If you want voice notes, session plan upload, or full history access

# Reflection Best Practices

How to get the most out of structured reflection. Tips from coaches who've made it work.

## The Golden Rules

### 1. Reflect Immediately

The best time to reflect is right after the session. Five minutes later beats five hours later. Five hours beats five days.

Your memory is freshest immediately after. Details are crisp. Emotions are real. Insights are clear.

Wait too long and you'll reconstruct rather than remember. Reconstructed reflections are less useful.

**Practical tip:** Reflect before you drive home. In the car park. On the touchline. While packing up equipment.

### 2. Be Specific

Vague reflections don't help.

❌ "Passing drill went well"
✅ "The triangle passing drill with rotation worked better than last week. Players understood the movement. Jake especially got it quickly."

❌ "Session was okay"
✅ "Warm-up engaged players quickly. Technical practice needed an earlier progression. SSG was excellent with the overload condition."

Specificity creates useful data. Vagueness creates noise.

### 3. Be Honest

The AI isn't judging you. Nobody else sees your reflections (unless you share them).

If the session was terrible, say so. If you made mistakes, note them. If you were underprepared, admit it.

Honest reflection accelerates learning. Sanitised reflection just makes you feel better in the moment while missing the growth opportunity.

### 4. Include Both Positive and Negative

Every session has both. Even great sessions have something that could be better. Even disasters have something that worked.

Balance matters for accurate analytics. If you only record negatives, your patterns will look worse than reality. If you only record positives, you'll miss development opportunities.

### 5. Name Players Specifically

"A player struggled" is less useful than "Tom struggled with ball shielding again."

Player names enable tracking. Over time, you'll see patterns: who you mention frequently, in what context, which players improve.

Be consistent with names. "Jake" always, not "Jake" sometimes and "J" other times.

## What to Include in Each Question

### What worked well today?

- Specific activities that succeeded
- Player behaviours that impressed you
- Coaching interventions that landed
- Moments of progress or breakthrough
- Things to repeat next time

### What didn't go as planned?

- Activities that fell flat
- Timing issues
- Player behaviour challenges
- Your own mistakes or oversights
- External factors that affected the session

### Were there any player standouts?

- Positive: Progress, effort, attitude, skill, leadership
- Concern: Withdrawal, struggle, behaviour, regression
- Surprise: Unexpected from this player (good or bad)

Always include context. Not just "Emma was great" but "Emma was great — organised the defence, communicated constantly, real leadership emerging."

### What areas need more work?

- Technical areas (passing, receiving, shooting, etc.)
- Tactical areas (pressing, shape, transitions)
- Physical areas (fitness, speed, endurance)
- Mental areas (confidence, focus, communication)
- Specific situations (2v1s, finishing, defending crosses)

### What will you focus on next session?

- Be specific and actionable
- Connect to what you observed today
- Create accountability for follow-through

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Waiting too long

Even a day later, your memory has shifted. Reflect while it's fresh.

**Fix:** Set a phone reminder for 10 minutes after your usual session end time.

### Mistake 2: Writing too little

One-word answers don't help future you.

**Fix:** Aim for at least 2-3 sentences per question. More detail = more useful analytics.

### Mistake 3: Writing too much

Reflections shouldn't take 20 minutes. You'll burn out and stop doing them.

**Fix:** Keep to 2-3 minutes total. Capture the essentials, not every detail.

### Mistake 4: Only reflecting on bad sessions

Good sessions have learning too. What made them good? How can you replicate it?

**Fix:** Reflect on every session, regardless of how it went.

### Mistake 5: Ignoring mood and energy ratings

They seem trivial but they're crucial for burnout detection.

**Fix:** Always rate. Make it automatic.

### Mistake 6: Never reviewing analytics

Reflection without review is just writing. The patterns are where learning happens.

**Fix:** Schedule a monthly 5-minute analytics review.

## Building the Habit

### Week 1-2: Establish the routine

Focus purely on doing it. After every session, reflect. Don't worry about quality yet.

### Week 3-4: Improve quality

Now that the habit exists, work on specificity. More detail, named players, honest observations.

### Month 2: Add analytics review

Start looking at your patterns. What themes emerge? What do the mood trends show?

### Month 3+: Refinement

Adjust your reflection style based on what's useful. Maybe you need more player mentions. Maybe less about logistics.

## When You're Struggling

### "I don't have time"

You have 2 minutes. If you don't have 2 minutes, you're heading for burnout anyway. The reflection might help you spot that.

### "I don't know what to write"

Use the five questions as prompts. They're designed to extract useful information even when you feel blank.

### "My reflections feel repetitive"

That's actually data. If you keep writing the same things, you've identified a pattern. What does that pattern tell you?

### "I keep forgetting to reflect"

Set a reminder. Make it part of your post-session routine. Put your phone somewhere you'll see it before leaving the venue.

### "It feels like a chore"

Start smaller. Just answer three questions. Or just do mood and energy ratings. Something is better than nothing.

## Advanced Practices

### Link reflections to planning

Before your next session, review your last reflection. What did you say you'd focus on? What patterns from recent sessions should influence this session's plan?

### Compare planned vs actual

If you upload session plans (Pro feature), explicitly reflect on the gap. Did you stick to the plan? What caused deviations? Was your timing realistic?

### Seasonal reviews

At the end of a season or block, review all your reflections. What were the big themes? How did you develop? What will you carry forward?

### Share with a mentor

If you have a coaching mentor, sharing selected reflections can make their feedback more specific and useful.

## The Compound Effect

One reflection teaches you little.

Ten reflections show early patterns.

Fifty reflections reveal real themes.

A season of reflections builds genuine insight into your coaching.

The value isn't in any single reflection. It's in the accumulation. Consistency beats intensity. Keep reflecting, even when individual sessions feel unremarkable.

Over time, you'll know yourself as a coach in ways that aren't possible without structured reflection.

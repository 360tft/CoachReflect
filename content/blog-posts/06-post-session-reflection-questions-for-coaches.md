# Post-Session Reflection Questions for Coaches

The session is over. Players have gone home. You are packing up equipment, and your mind is already racing through what just happened. That drill in the middle fell apart. The energy was flat at the start. But then something clicked in the last twenty minutes and suddenly everything looked sharper.

Most of us have these thoughts. Very few of us capture them. And almost none of us ask the right questions to turn those fleeting observations into lasting improvement.

In my experience, the coaches who develop fastest are not necessarily the ones with the most qualifications or the biggest budgets. They are the ones who consistently ask themselves honest questions after every session and, crucially, do something with the answers.

This guide covers the questions I believe every coach should consider after training sessions and matches. You do not need to answer all of them every time. Pick the ones that matter most for where you are right now.

## Key Takeaways

- Structured reflection questions accelerate coaching development far more than casual thinking
- Group your questions into categories so you cover blind spots, not just what is top of mind
- The quality of your answers matters more than the quantity of questions
- Reviewing your answers over weeks and months reveals patterns you cannot see in the moment
- Even five minutes of focused reflection after a session compounds into significant growth over a season

## Why Questions Matter More Than Observations

There is a difference between thinking about a session and reflecting on it. Thinking tends to be reactive. You replay the moments that stood out, usually the things that went wrong or the things that went brilliantly. Reflection is structured. It forces you to examine areas you might otherwise ignore.

I have found that without specific questions, most coaches default to one of two modes: self-criticism ("that was rubbish") or self-congratulation ("that went well"). Neither is particularly useful. Questions push you into the space between those extremes, where the real learning happens.

## The Essential Post-Session Reflection Questions

### Session Design and Delivery

These questions examine how well you planned and executed the session itself.

**1. Did the session achieve what I intended?**

This sounds obvious, but it is remarkable how often we finish a session without checking whether the original objective was met. If you set out to improve decision-making under pressure, did the activities actually create pressure? If the goal was building confidence, did the environment allow players to succeed?

When the answer is no, the follow-up question matters even more: was the objective wrong, or was the delivery wrong? These require very different responses.

**2. What would I change if I ran this session again tomorrow?**

This is perhaps the single most valuable question you can ask. It forces specificity. Not "it could have been better" but "I would make the playing area smaller in the second activity" or "I would demonstrate the technique before letting them try it."

Write the answer down. You will thank yourself when you revisit this session next season.

**3. How effective were my explanations and instructions?**

Were players clear on what was expected? Did you spend too long explaining, or not long enough? I have found that the temptation to over-explain is one of the hardest habits to break. If players looked confused during an activity, the issue might not be their understanding but your communication.

**4. Did the session flow well, or were there unnecessary stoppages?**

Transitions between activities are where sessions often lose momentum. Consider whether your setup was efficient, whether equipment changes were smooth, and whether you managed time well across the different phases.

### Player Performance and Development

These questions shift the focus from your coaching to the players' experience and progress.

**5. Which players showed progress today, and in what specific area?**

Be specific. "Ella was good" tells you nothing useful in three months. "Ella showed improved composure when receiving under pressure in the second rondo" gives you something to build on.

**6. Which players struggled, and what might be behind it?**

Struggling is not always a bad sign. If a player is being challenged appropriately, some struggle is expected. But if a player who normally performs well suddenly drops off, that warrants attention. Consider technical, tactical, physical, and emotional factors. Sometimes the answer has nothing to do with the sport.

**7. Did I give enough attention to all players, or did I gravitate towards certain individuals?**

This is an uncomfortable question, which is precisely why it is important. Most of us unconsciously spend more time with the players who are either the most talented or the most disruptive. The quiet ones in the middle often get the least coaching input, despite potentially having the most to gain.

### Environment and Culture

The atmosphere you create is just as important as the drills you deliver.

**8. What was the energy and mood of the group today?**

Was there enthusiasm? Were players engaged, or going through the motions? Did the energy change at different points? Tracking mood over time reveals patterns. You might discover that sessions on certain days are consistently flat, or that particular types of activity always generate energy.

**9. Did every player feel included and valued?**

This question matters at every level, from grassroots to elite. Consider whether your groupings, your feedback, and your body language communicated that every player belongs. Inclusion is not just about giving everyone equal time on the pitch. It is about ensuring every player feels seen.

**10. Were there any behavioural issues, and how did I handle them?**

If there were disruptions, consider whether they were a symptom of something else: boredom, confusion, frustration, or something happening outside of training. Also consider your response. Did you react in the moment, or did you respond with intention? There is a significant difference.

### Self-Assessment

These are the hardest questions because they require genuine honesty.

**11. What was my emotional state during the session, and did it affect my coaching?**

We all have off days. The question is not whether your mood affected the session but whether you were aware of it. If you arrived stressed and found yourself being short with players, recognising that connection is the first step to managing it.

**12. What did I do well today that I want to keep doing?**

Reflection is not just about fixing problems. Identifying your strengths and reinforcing them is equally important. If your demonstrations were clear, your praise was specific, or your questioning drew out great responses from players, note it down. These are the behaviours you want to become habits.

**13. What is one thing I want to focus on improving in my next session?**

Just one. Not five. Not a complete overhaul of your coaching style. One specific, actionable thing. Maybe it is reducing your talking time. Maybe it is positioning yourself better to observe. Maybe it is being more specific with your feedback. Pick one and commit to it.

## Questions for Match Days

Match days require a slightly different lens. In addition to the questions above, consider these:

**14. Did my preparation give the team the best chance of performing well?**

This covers everything from your pre-match talk to your tactical setup to the warm-up structure. Were players clear on their roles? Did they look ready?

**15. How well did I manage the game in real time?**

Consider your substitutions, your tactical adjustments, your communication during the match. Were your decisions reactive or proactive? Did you make changes early enough, or did you wait too long hoping things would improve on their own?

## How to Actually Use Your Answers

Answering these questions is only half the process. The real value comes from what you do with the answers over time.

### Look for Patterns

After a few weeks of consistent reflection, themes will emerge. You might notice that your sessions always lose energy in the middle third. Or that you consistently struggle with one particular aspect of your coaching. These patterns are invisible in the moment but obvious in hindsight, and they are where your biggest development gains live.

### Set Specific Goals

Use your reflections to set concrete, measurable goals for yourself. Not "be a better communicator" but "keep my initial explanations to under thirty seconds for the next four sessions." Specific goals are achievable goals.

### Review Monthly

Set aside twenty minutes at the end of each month to read back through your reflections. I have found that monthly reviews are where the real insights appear. You will spot progress you did not notice, identify recurring challenges, and generate ideas that only emerge from seeing the bigger picture.

### Share Selectively

If you work with other coaches, consider sharing some of your reflections. Not as a performance review, but as a collaborative development tool. When coaches reflect together, the quality of insight increases dramatically because someone else will notice things you have become blind to.

## Common Mistakes with Post-Session Reflection

### Being Too Vague

"It went okay" is not a reflection. Push yourself to be specific. What went okay? For whom? Compared to what? The more precise your observations, the more useful they become.

### Only Reflecting When Things Go Wrong

If you only reflect after bad sessions, you are missing half the picture. Good sessions contain just as much learning. Understanding why something worked is essential for being able to replicate it.

### Trying to Answer Every Question Every Time

That is a recipe for burnout. Pick three or four questions that feel most relevant after each session. Rotate through the full list over time so you cover all the categories, but do not turn reflection into a chore.

### Not Writing It Down

Thinking about it on the drive home is not the same as writing it down. Thoughts are fleeting. Written reflections are permanent, searchable, and reviewable. The act of writing also forces clarity in a way that thinking alone does not.

## Making Reflection Effortless

The biggest barrier to consistent reflection is time. After a long session, the last thing most coaches want to do is sit down and write. That is why the format matters as much as the content.

The most effective reflection habit I have seen is one that takes less than five minutes, happens immediately after the session while details are fresh, and follows a consistent structure so you do not have to think about what to write.

That is exactly what [Coach Reflection](https://coachreflection.com) is designed to do. It gives you guided prompts tailored to your session, captures your thoughts quickly, and tracks patterns over time so you can see your development across weeks and months. If you have ever wanted to reflect more consistently but struggled with the discipline, it is worth a look.

Your next session is an opportunity. The question is whether you will remember what it taught you.

# FA Coaching CPD Requirements: Everything You Need to Know

If you hold an FA coaching qualification, CPD is not optional. It is a condition of keeping your licence active. But if you are like most grassroots coaches, the specifics of what you actually need to do are somewhere between vague and confusing.

How many hours? What counts? Where do you log it? What happens if you do not complete it? And does watching a YouTube video about pressing triggers at eleven o'clock at night really count as professional development?

I have spoken with enough coaches to know that CPD is one of those things most people understand in principle but struggle with in practice. Not because they are not developing. Most coaches are learning and improving all the time. The problem is documentation. The evidence. The paperwork.

This guide lays out the FA's CPD requirements clearly, by qualification level, and explains what counts, what does not, how to log it, and how to make sure you never have to scramble at renewal time again.

## Key Takeaways

- The FA requires CPD for all coaching qualifications. The exact requirements vary by badge level, but the principle is the same: demonstrate ongoing development or risk losing your licence
- For most FA qualifications, you need to complete at least 15 hours of CPD within a three-year cycle
- CPD is broader than most coaches realise. Courses, mentoring, self-reflection, observing other coaches, reading, and community discussion all count
- Evidence must be logged through the FA's system, and the quality of your evidence matters more than the quantity
- Structured reflection after sessions generates CPD evidence automatically, eliminating the last-minute documentation scramble

## What Is CPD?

Continuing Professional Development is exactly what it sounds like: ongoing learning and development beyond your initial qualification. The FA, like most governing bodies, recognises that a coaching badge is a starting point, not an endpoint. The game evolves, research advances, and coaching methods develop. CPD ensures that qualified coaches stay current and continue improving.

CPD is not just about attending courses, though courses count. It includes any structured activity that develops your coaching knowledge, skills, or practice. The emphasis is on structured and developmental. Going to training and delivering the same session you have delivered for three years is not CPD, even though you are technically coaching. Trying a new session design based on something you learned, reflecting on the outcome, and adjusting your approach is CPD.

The distinction matters because CPD is about intentional development, not just accumulated hours.

## FA CPD Requirements by Qualification Level

The FA has restructured its coaching pathway in recent years, so the qualification names have changed. Here is how CPD requirements map across both the old and new naming conventions.

### FA Playmaker / Introduction to Coaching Football (formerly FA Level 1)

This is the entry-level qualification. CPD requirements at this level are minimal, and in some cases the FA does not enforce a formal CPD cycle for Playmaker holders. However, the FA encourages all coaches to engage in ongoing development regardless of level.

If you hold a Playmaker and plan to progress, demonstrating CPD strengthens your application for higher qualifications.

### FA Level 2 / FA Youth Award / FA Adult Award

This is where CPD requirements become formalised. Coaches holding Level 2 or equivalent qualifications are expected to complete CPD within a rolling cycle.

**Typical requirement:** 15 hours of CPD across a three-year cycle.

That works out to roughly five hours per year, which is less than most coaches realise. A single coaching workshop might cover three hours. Two months of post-session reflection covers the rest.

The FA wants to see a mix of activities:

- Formal learning (courses, workshops, webinars)
- Practice-based learning (trying new approaches, peer observation)
- Self-directed learning (reflection, reading, research)

### UEFA B Licence

The UEFA B is where CPD becomes more structured and more strictly enforced. This is a significant qualification, and the FA takes licence maintenance seriously.

**Typical requirement:** 15 hours minimum across a three-year cycle, logged and evidenced through the FA system. Some County FAs may require additional engagement.

At this level, the FA expects to see depth in your CPD, not just hours. Evidence should demonstrate that you are engaging critically with your coaching, not just attending events passively.

**What good UEFA B CPD looks like:**

- Attending FA-organised CPD events and workshops
- Completing online modules through the FA Learning platform
- Engaging in mentoring (as mentor or mentee)
- Structured observation of other coaches with written reflection
- Sustained self-reflection documented over time
- Reading and applying coaching research or literature

### UEFA A Licence and Above

At UEFA A and above, CPD requirements are more demanding and more closely monitored. These licences are significant professional qualifications, and the FA (and UEFA) expects holders to demonstrate sustained, high-quality development.

**Requirements:** Typically 15-20 hours per cycle, with more emphasis on formal CPD activities, mentoring, and contribution to the coaching community. UEFA A holders are often expected to engage with FA-organised events specifically.

At this level, your CPD evidence needs to show progression and depth. A list of workshops attended is not sufficient. The FA wants to see how your coaching practice has evolved, what you have learned, and how you have applied it.

## What Counts as CPD

This is where most coaches underestimate what they are already doing. CPD is much broader than attending courses.

### Activities that count as CPD

- **Formal courses and workshops** -- FA-organised events, County FA workshops, private coaching courses
- **Online learning** -- FA Learning platform modules, webinars, online courses from recognised providers
- **Mentoring** -- Both receiving mentoring and mentoring other coaches
- **Peer observation** -- Watching other coaches deliver sessions, with structured reflection on what you observed
- **Self-reflection** -- Structured reflection on your own sessions, ideally documented with dates and specific learning points
- **Reading and research** -- Coaching books, academic papers, reputable coaching blogs and articles
- **Community discussion** -- Coaching forums, coaching communities, structured group discussions about coaching practice
- **Conference attendance** -- Coaching conferences, seminars, guest speaker events
- **Video analysis** -- Analysing your own sessions or matches, or studying footage of other coaches or teams
- **Multi-sport observation** -- Watching and reflecting on coaching in other sports (the FA actively encourages this)

### What does NOT typically count

- Simply delivering your regular coaching sessions without reflection or development intent
- Watching football matches as a spectator (unless you are doing structured tactical analysis with documentation)
- Social media scrolling, even if you occasionally see a coaching post
- Activities with no documented reflection or learning outcome

### The golden rule

If you can articulate what you learned and how it applies to your coaching, it probably counts. If you cannot, it probably does not.

## What Evidence Does the FA Accept?

Evidence quality matters more than evidence quantity. The FA is not looking for a stack of certificates. It is looking for demonstration of genuine engagement with your development.

### Strong evidence

- Written reflections from your coaching sessions with dates, specific observations, and learning points
- Notes from courses or workshops that include what you learned and how you will apply it
- Mentoring logs showing topics discussed, insights gained, and actions taken
- Observation reports from watching other coaches, with reflection on what you would adopt or adapt
- CPD plans that set development goals and review progress against them

### Weaker evidence

- Course attendance certificates alone (attendance without learning evidence)
- Generic statements like "I improved my communication this year" without specific examples
- A list of activities without any reflection on what was learned

### How to make your evidence stronger

Connect everything back to your coaching practice. The FA does not want a list of what you did. It wants to see how your coaching changed as a result. "I attended a workshop on player-centred coaching" is attendance. "I attended a workshop on player-centred coaching and started using guided discovery questions in my sessions. I noticed that players were more engaged and started solving problems independently, though I found it harder to manage time" is CPD evidence.

## How to Log and Submit Your CPD

### The FA Learning Platform

The FA uses its online learning platform for CPD tracking. You can access it through your FA account. The platform allows you to:

- Log CPD activities with descriptions and evidence
- Track your hours against your cycle requirements
- Upload supporting documents (certificates, reflection notes, observation reports)
- Submit your CPD portfolio for review at the end of your cycle

### County FA

Your local County FA is your point of contact for CPD queries. They can clarify requirements for your specific qualification, advise on what evidence they expect, and help if you are struggling to meet your hours.

Many County FAs also organise CPD events specifically for their coaches. These are often free or low-cost and count directly toward your requirements.

### Tips for logging effectively

- **Log as you go.** Do not wait until the end of your cycle. Log activities within a week of completing them while details are fresh.
- **Be specific.** "Coaching workshop" is vague. "County FA workshop on session design for under-9s, 3 hours, focused on constraint-led approach" is useful.
- **Include the learning, not just the activity.** Every log entry should include what you took away from it.
- **Keep digital copies.** Certificates, notes, and reflections should be saved digitally where you can find them.

## What Happens If You Do Not Complete Your CPD

This is the question most coaches quietly worry about. The consequences vary depending on your qualification level and how much of your CPD you have completed.

**At lower levels (Level 2 and equivalents):** The FA may send reminders and allow extensions. In practice, enforcement has been inconsistent, but the expectation is that this will become stricter over time.

**At UEFA B and above:** Failure to complete CPD within your cycle can result in your licence being suspended or lapsing. A lapsed licence means you would need to revalidate or potentially retake elements of the qualification to reinstate it.

**The practical impact:** Many clubs, leagues, and organisations now check coaching qualifications before allowing coaches to work with players. An expired or suspended licence can prevent you from coaching, regardless of your experience.

**The bottom line:** Complete your CPD. The requirements are not onerous, especially once you build reflection into your routine. The risk of losing a qualification you worked hard to earn is not worth it.

## Other Home Nations and International Comparisons

### Scottish FA

The Scottish FA operates a similar CPD framework. Coaches holding SFA qualifications are expected to complete ongoing development, with requirements varying by licence level. The SFA emphasises a portfolio-based approach, where coaches compile evidence of development over their licence cycle.

### Football Association of Wales (FAW)

The FAW requires CPD for its coaching qualifications, aligned with UEFA guidelines for B Licence and above. Requirements are similar to the FA: a mix of formal and informal development activities, documented and submitted within a cycle.

### Irish Football Association (IFA) / Football Association of Ireland (FAI)

Both the IFA (Northern Ireland) and FAI (Republic of Ireland) have CPD requirements for coaching qualifications. The frameworks are broadly similar to the FA's, with local variations in how evidence is submitted and what events are available.

### US Soccer

For comparison, US Soccer requires coaches to complete continuing education to maintain their licences. The US Soccer system uses a combination of online modules, in-person events, and self-directed learning. The D licence requires renewal every two years, and higher licences have more demanding requirements.

The notable difference is that US Soccer has historically placed more emphasis on formal course completion, while the FA has moved toward accepting a broader range of development activities including self-reflection.

## How Reflection Makes CPD Effortless

Here is what I have found transforms CPD from a burden into a by-product.

If you reflect after every coaching session, even briefly, you are generating CPD evidence automatically. Each reflection is a documented instance of self-assessment, learning, and forward planning. Over a season of thirty to forty sessions, you accumulate a substantial body of evidence that demonstrates genuine engagement with your development.

Compare that to the alternative: scrambling at the end of your three-year cycle to remember what you learned and compile a portfolio from memory. One approach is effortless and honest. The other is stressful and often unconvincing.

### What a single reflection provides as CPD evidence

- **Date and context** (when, what type of session)
- **Self-assessment** (what worked, what did not)
- **Learning** (what you discovered or realised)
- **Forward planning** (what you will change or try next)

That is four of the five elements most CPD systems require, generated in five minutes.

### Building a CPD portfolio from reflections

At the end of each month, review your reflections. Note the themes. Write a one-paragraph summary of your development that month. At the end of your CPD cycle, compile these monthly summaries, add any course certificates or observation notes, and you have a portfolio that demonstrates sustained, genuine development.

No scrambling. No fabrication. No stress.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many CPD hours do I need for my FA coaching badge?

Most FA qualifications require 15 hours of CPD within a three-year cycle. This works out to roughly 5 hours per year. UEFA A and above may require more. Check with your County FA for the specific requirements for your qualification level, as these can vary.

### Does watching coaching videos on YouTube count as CPD?

It can, provided you document what you watched, what you learned, and how it applies to your coaching. Passively watching clips is not CPD. Watching a specific video on pressing triggers, taking notes on the key principles, and then trying them in your next session with a reflection on the outcome is CPD.

### Do I need to attend paid courses to meet my CPD requirements?

No. While formal courses count toward CPD, they are not the only option. Self-reflection, peer observation, mentoring conversations, reading, and community discussion all count. Many coaches meet their requirements entirely through free activities.

### What if I coach but do not hold a formal qualification?

CPD requirements only apply to coaches holding recognised qualifications. However, engaging in development activities is beneficial regardless of your qualification status. If you plan to pursue qualifications in the future, a documented history of development strengthens your application.

### Can I use my post-session reflections as CPD evidence?

Yes. Structured reflections that include the date, session context, what you learned, and what you plan to change are exactly the kind of evidence CPD systems are designed to capture. The FA values genuine, ongoing self-assessment over one-off course certificates.

### How do I know if my CPD has been accepted?

Log your CPD through the FA Learning platform and check your progress against your cycle requirements. If you are unsure whether a specific activity counts, contact your County FA. It is better to ask than to assume.

### Can Coach Reflection help with FA CPD?

Coach Reflection's export feature generates a timestamped record of your reflections, learning points, and development themes, which is exactly what CPD portfolios need. If you reflect after your sessions in the app, your CPD evidence builds itself. When renewal time comes, you export rather than scramble.

# How to Reflect on Your Coaching Sessions (A Complete Guide)

You have just finished a session. The cones are in the bag, the bibs are collected, and the last player has been picked up. On the drive home, your mind replays moments. The warm-up felt sluggish. That small-sided game in the middle was brilliant. You lost the group for about five minutes during the transition.

These thoughts are valuable. They contain the seeds of real coaching improvement. But for most of us, they evaporate by the time we walk through the front door. Gone. Replaced by whatever happens next.

Something I have noticed over years of coaching is that the difference between coaches who steadily improve and coaches who plateau is not talent or qualifications. It is whether they capture and process what happens in their sessions. Not occasionally, not when things go badly, but consistently.

This guide covers everything you need to know about reflecting on your coaching sessions. The main reflective models, what to actually write down, when to do it, how to build the habit, and the mistakes that trip most people up.

## Key Takeaways

- Reflective practice is the single most effective tool for coaching development, and it costs nothing but a few minutes of your time
- Three established models (Gibbs, Kolb, Driscoll) provide structure, but the best model is the one you will actually use
- A "3-question minimum" after every session is more valuable than a detailed analysis you only do once a month
- Hot reviews (immediately after) and cold reviews (next day) serve different purposes, and the best coaches do both
- Digital tools reduce friction, but the medium matters less than the consistency
- Common mistakes include only reflecting after bad sessions, being too vague, and never reviewing old reflections

## Why Reflection Matters for Coaches

There is a well-known idea in coaching education that experience alone does not make you better. Ten seasons of coaching without deliberate reflection is one season repeated ten times.

I have found this to be true. I can think of coaches with twenty years of experience who still make the same communication mistakes they made in year one. And I can think of coaches with two years of experience who are developing rapidly because they think carefully about every session they deliver.

Reflection is the mechanism that turns experience into learning. Without it, you rely on instinct and habit. With it, you build a body of self-knowledge that informs every decision you make on the training ground.

### What the research says

The concept of reflective practice in professional development goes back to Donald Schon's work in the 1980s. He distinguished between reflection-in-action (thinking on your feet during a session) and reflection-on-action (thinking back after the session is over). Both matter, but reflection-on-action is where most of the deep learning happens because you have the space to think without the pressure of the moment.

More recently, sports coaching research has consistently found that coaches who engage in structured reflection show greater self-awareness, better decision-making, and faster development than those who do not.

### What this means practically

You do not need to read research papers to benefit from reflection. You just need a few minutes, a few honest questions, and somewhere to record your answers.

## The Three Main Reflective Models

If you have done any coaching qualifications, you have probably encountered at least one of these. They are frameworks for structuring your thinking after a session. None of them is perfect, and you do not need to follow any of them rigidly. But understanding them gives you options.

### Gibbs Reflective Cycle

Graham Gibbs published this model in 1988, and it remains the most widely used in coaching education. It has six stages that form a cycle.

**1. Description** -- What happened? Stick to the facts. Do not interpret or evaluate yet. Just describe the session or the specific moment you want to reflect on.

*Example: "I ran a 4v4 possession game. After ten minutes, two players were arguing about whether a ball had gone out of play. I stopped the game and spoke to both players."*

**2. Feelings** -- What were you thinking and feeling? This stage is often skipped by coaches who think emotions are irrelevant. They are not. Your emotional state directly affects your coaching decisions.

*Example: "I felt frustrated because the session had been flowing well. I was also worried that the argument would spread to the rest of the group."*

**3. Evaluation** -- What was good and bad about the experience? Start making judgements about what happened.

*Example: "Stopping the game quickly was the right call. But I think I addressed it too publicly. Both players looked embarrassed."*

**4. Analysis** -- What sense can you make of the situation? Dig deeper. Why did things happen the way they did? What factors were at play?

*Example: "The playing area was probably too small for 4v4 at that intensity. The ball was going out frequently, which created frustration. The argument was a symptom, not the cause."*

**5. Conclusion** -- What else could you have done? What have you learned?

*Example: "I could have pulled the two players aside rather than addressing it in front of everyone. I also need to think about pitch sizes more carefully for competitive small-sided games."*

**6. Action Plan** -- If it happened again, what would you do? What will you change?

*Example: "Next session I will increase the playing area by two metres each way. If a dispute arises, I will speak to players individually rather than stopping the whole game."*

The strength of Gibbs is its structure. It forces you through stages you might otherwise skip, particularly feelings and analysis. The weakness is that it can feel slow and formal for everyday use.

### Kolb's Experiential Learning Cycle

David Kolb's model, published in 1984, has four stages. It is simpler than Gibbs and focuses more on learning through doing.

**1. Concrete Experience** -- Something happens. You deliver a session, try a new drill, or have an interaction with a player.

**2. Reflective Observation** -- You think about what happened. What did you notice? What stood out?

**3. Abstract Conceptualisation** -- You draw conclusions. What does this tell you about your coaching, your players, or the activity? You might connect it to something you have read, learned on a course, or observed elsewhere.

**4. Active Experimentation** -- You try something new based on your conclusions. This becomes a new concrete experience, and the cycle repeats.

Kolb's model works well for coaches because it emphasises the link between reflection and action. It is not just about thinking. It is about thinking in order to do something differently.

*Coaching example: You notice that your players switch off during your half-time talk (experience). You think about why: perhaps you are talking for too long and covering too many points (observation). You read an article about keeping half-time instructions to three key messages maximum (conceptualisation). Next match, you limit yourself to three points and keep the talk under ninety seconds (experimentation). Then you observe whether the players respond differently.*

### Driscoll's What? Model

John Driscoll's model is the simplest of the three. It uses three questions.

**What?** -- What happened? Describe the situation.

**So what?** -- So what does this mean? Why does it matter? What have you learned?

**Now what?** -- Now what will you do differently? What is your next step?

This model is excellent for coaches who find Gibbs too formal or Kolb too abstract. The three questions are easy to remember, quick to answer, and naturally lead to action.

*Coaching example: "What? My goalkeeper session was too focused on shot-stopping and did not include any distribution work, even though that was the original plan. So what? I ran out of time because the first activity overran. I need to be more disciplined with timings. Now what? I will set a timer on my phone for each activity next session and stick to it."*

### Which model should you use?

Whichever one you will actually use. That is genuinely the answer.

If you like structure and thoroughness, use Gibbs. If you think in terms of learning cycles, use Kolb. If you want something fast and practical, use Driscoll.

You can also mix them. Use Driscoll's three questions for your everyday reflections and pull out Gibbs for significant moments that need deeper analysis.

## What to Capture After Every Session: The 3-Question Minimum

If the reflective models feel like too much for daily use, start here. These three questions take less than five minutes and capture the essential learning from any session.

**1. What went well, and why?**

Not just what happened, but why it worked. "The rondo was good" is an observation. "The rondo worked because I made the area bigger than last time, which gave players more time on the ball and reduced turnovers" is a reflection. The why is where the learning lives.

**2. What did not go as expected?**

Notice the phrasing. Not "what went wrong" but "what did not go as expected." This removes the self-criticism and focuses on learning. Sometimes things go differently from what you planned and the result is better. That is worth capturing too.

**3. What will I do differently next time?**

This question turns reflection into action. Without it, you are just journaling. With it, you are building a plan for improvement. Be specific. "Be better at communication" is not actionable. "Keep my instructions under twenty seconds for the first activity" is.

These three questions are your non-negotiable minimum. If you answer nothing else, answer these. Over a season of forty sessions, you will have one hundred and twenty data points about your coaching. That is a remarkable body of self-knowledge.

## Hot Reviews vs Cold Reviews

In my experience, the timing of your reflection changes what you capture. Both have value.

### Hot reviews (immediately after the session)

A hot review happens in the first thirty minutes after a session, ideally before you leave the venue.

**Strengths:**
- Details are fresh and accurate
- Emotional responses are captured honestly
- You remember specific moments, player names, exact sequences
- Takes less time because you do not have to reconstruct what happened

**Weaknesses:**
- Your judgement may be clouded by the emotion of the session
- You might fixate on one dramatic moment and miss the broader picture
- If the session went badly, you might be too frustrated for balanced analysis

### Cold reviews (the next day or later)

A cold review happens after you have had time to process. Usually the next morning or the following day.

**Strengths:**
- Emotional distance allows more balanced evaluation
- You can see the session in context (how it fits within your programme)
- You might notice things you missed in the moment
- Better for drawing broader conclusions

**Weaknesses:**
- Details fade quickly; you will forget specific moments
- You might unconsciously rewrite what happened to fit a narrative
- Takes more effort because you have to recall the session

### The ideal approach

Do both. A brief hot review immediately after (two to three minutes, capture the key facts and your gut reaction) and a slightly longer cold review the next day (five minutes, add analysis and action points). The hot review preserves the details. The cold review provides the perspective.

If you can only do one, choose the hot review. Details are more perishable than perspective.

## Building the Reflection Habit

Knowing you should reflect and actually doing it are different things. The barrier is rarely motivation. It is friction. After a session, you are tired, busy, and your mind has already moved on. Here is what I have found works for making reflection stick.

### Attach it to an existing habit

The most reliable way to build a new habit is to attach it to something you already do. If you always pack up equipment after training, reflect while you pack up. If you always sit in the car for a few minutes before driving home, use those minutes. If you always have a coffee the morning after, reflect with your coffee.

### Make it stupidly easy

The lower the barrier, the more likely you are to do it. A voice note on your phone takes thirty seconds. Three bullet points in a notes app takes sixty seconds. A structured journal entry takes five minutes. Start with whatever feels effortless and build from there.

### Do not aim for perfection

A messy, honest, two-sentence reflection is infinitely more valuable than a polished analysis you never write. Lower your standards for the first month. The quality improves naturally once the habit is established.

### Set a minimum, not a target

Tell yourself you will write one sentence after every session. Just one. On most days, you will write more because once you start, thoughts flow. But on the days when you are exhausted, one sentence still counts. The streak matters more than any individual entry.

### Review your reflections monthly

This is the step most coaches skip, and it is where the compound value appears. Set aside fifteen to twenty minutes once a month to read back through your reflections. You will spot patterns you could not see in real time. Recurring challenges, gradual progress, themes that keep appearing. Monthly reviews turn individual reflections into a development narrative.

## Digital vs Paper: Which Is Better?

This question comes up frequently, and the honest answer is that neither is objectively better. Each has trade-offs.

### Paper journals

- No distractions (no notifications, no apps competing for attention)
- The physical act of writing may aid memory and processing
- Feels personal and private
- Cannot be searched, sorted, or analysed over time
- Easy to lose or damage
- No backup

### Digital tools

- Searchable across weeks and months
- Can include voice notes, which are faster than writing
- Data can be analysed for patterns over time
- Always with you (phone is always in your pocket)
- Can generate reports or exports for CPD evidence
- Risk of distraction from other apps

### What I have found

Most coaches who start with paper eventually switch to digital, primarily because the ability to search and review past reflections becomes increasingly valuable over time. After six months, you want to find what you wrote about a specific drill or a particular player challenge. With paper, that means flipping through pages. With a digital tool, it takes seconds.

The medium is less important than the consistency. Pick whichever reduces friction for you and commit to it for at least three months before switching.

## Common Mistakes in Coaching Reflection

### Only reflecting after bad sessions

If you only reflect when things go wrong, you learn what to avoid but not what to replicate. Good sessions contain just as much learning as bad ones. Understanding why something worked is essential for doing it again on purpose rather than by accident.

### Being too vague

"Session was decent. Players seemed to enjoy it." This tells you nothing useful in a week's time. Push for specifics. Which players? Which activity? What did they enjoy? Why? Vague reflections feel productive in the moment but provide no value when reviewed later.

### Never acting on your reflections

Reflection without action is just journaling. Every reflection should end with something you will do differently, try next time, or pay attention to. If you review a month of reflections and nothing changed in your coaching, the reflections are not doing their job.

### Making it too complicated

If your reflection process takes twenty minutes, you will not do it consistently. Simplicity sustains habits. Complexity kills them. Start with the 3-question minimum and add depth only when the basic habit is rock solid.

### Never reviewing past reflections

Individual reflections are useful. A collection of reflections reviewed over time is transformative. The patterns, trends, and development arcs that emerge from weeks and months of data are invisible in any single entry. Schedule monthly reviews and protect that time.

### Confusing description with reflection

Writing down what happened is not the same as reflecting on it. "We did a passing drill, then a rondo, then a game" is a description. "The rondo worked better than last week because I added a rule about maximum touches, which forced faster decision-making" is a reflection. The difference is analysis.

## Turning Reflection Into Development

Reflection on its own is not the goal. Development is. Here is how to make sure your reflections translate into actual coaching improvement.

### Set development goals based on patterns

After a month of reflections, identify one or two recurring themes. Perhaps your transitions consistently lose momentum. Perhaps you keep noting that your instructions are too long. Turn these patterns into specific, time-bound goals. "For the next four sessions, I will keep all instructions under twenty seconds."

### Share selectively with trusted peers

If you work with other coaches, sharing occasional reflections can accelerate your development significantly. Another coach will notice things you have become blind to. This is not about performance review. It is about collaborative learning.

### Connect reflections to your CPD

If you hold a coaching qualification that requires Continuing Professional Development, your reflections are CPD evidence. They demonstrate learning, self-assessment, and forward planning, which is exactly what CPD frameworks are looking for. Some digital tools even allow you to export reflections in a CPD-ready format.

### Track progress over time

Revisit your development goals at the end of each month. Are you making progress? Has the issue you identified resolved itself, or is it persistent? This kind of longitudinal self-assessment is rare among coaches and incredibly powerful for those who do it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should a coaching reflection take?

Five minutes is a good target for a post-session reflection. Some will take two minutes, some might take ten if something significant happened. The 3-question minimum can be completed in under three minutes. The key is consistency rather than depth. A brief reflection after every session is more valuable than a detailed one you do sporadically.

### Do I need to use a formal reflective model like Gibbs?

No. The models are useful frameworks, especially when you are starting out or when you want to analyse a specific moment in depth. But for everyday reflections, a simple set of questions works just as well. Use Gibbs or Kolb for significant incidents and the 3-question minimum for routine sessions.

### What if I coach multiple sessions per week?

Reflect after each one, even briefly. If you coach five sessions per week, the 3-question minimum takes fifteen minutes across the entire week. That is a small investment for the development return. If some sessions are similar (same age group, same objectives), you might combine reflections, but try to capture something specific from each session.

### Is reflecting on my own enough, or should I involve other people?

Reflecting on your own is valuable and sustainable. Involving others, through peer reflection, mentoring conversations, or co-coaching reviews, adds another dimension. Other people see things you miss. If you have access to a trusted coaching colleague, occasional shared reflection is worth the effort.

### Can I use voice notes instead of writing?

Absolutely. Voice notes are faster, capture emotion and nuance that writing sometimes filters out, and have a much lower barrier to entry. The trade-off is that voice notes are harder to search and review than written reflections. Some coaches record a voice note immediately after the session (hot review) and write a brief summary the next day (cold review), getting the best of both approaches.

### How do I know if my reflections are actually improving my coaching?

Review your reflections monthly and look for evidence of change. Are you trying new things based on what you noted? Are recurring issues becoming less frequent? Are you making different decisions in sessions? If your reflections consistently identify a problem but nothing changes, the reflection process needs adjusting, probably by making the action planning step more specific and accountable.

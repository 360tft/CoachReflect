# How to Reflect After a Football Training Session

You have just finished a session. Cones are in the bag. Players are heading off. You have a window of about thirty minutes where everything is still fresh. The drill that worked brilliantly. The one that fell flat. The player who clicked with something new. The moment where you talked for too long and lost the group.

Most coaches let that window close without capturing anything. Not because they do not care, but because there is no system in place. There is no prompt asking them what happened. No structure to hang their thoughts on. So the observations drift away, replaced by the drive home, dinner, and the admin that fills every evening.

This post is a practical guide to building a post-session reflection habit. Not theory about why reflection matters (you already know that), but the actual mechanics of how to do it consistently without it feeling like homework.

## Key Takeaways

- Post-session reflection is most effective within 30 minutes of the session ending.
- You do not need to write essays. Five focused minutes is enough.
- Consistency matters more than depth. Brief reflections after every session beat detailed reflections once a month.
- Good reflection is specific. "Session went well" teaches you nothing. "The 4v2 rondo worked because the area was small enough to force quick decisions" teaches you something you can repeat.
- Reflection without review is just writing. The value comes from looking back across multiple entries and spotting patterns.

## When to Reflect

The best time to reflect is immediately after the session or within a few hours. Your memory is sharpest, the emotions are still present (which is useful data in itself), and the specifics have not yet blurred into generalities.

For most grassroots coaches, this means one of three windows:

**In the car on the way home.** This is when voice notes are invaluable. You cannot type, but you can speak. Record two or three minutes of unstructured thoughts. What went well. What did not. What you want to remember. You can structure it later, or let an AI tool like Coach Reflection do it for you.

**That evening after the kids are in bed.** Not ideal because some detail has faded, but still workable if you jotted down a couple of keywords during the session. Even "rondo - too big" or "Jake - confident today" is enough to trigger the full memory when you sit down to write.

**The next morning.** The outer limit. Beyond this, you are relying on general impressions rather than specific observations. Still better than nothing, but you lose the granularity that makes reflection genuinely useful.

## What to Capture

You do not need to write about everything. Focus on what will help you coach better next time. Here are the five areas I find most useful.

### 1. Did the Session Achieve Its Objectives?

Every session should have an objective, even an informal one. "Improve passing under pressure." "Work on defensive transitions." "Build confidence in the new players." Whatever it was, did you achieve it?

Be honest. If the answer is no, that is fine. The interesting bit is why. Was the activity wrong for the objective? Was the group not ready? Did you spend too long setting up and run out of time? Knowing why something did not work is more valuable than knowing that it did.

### 2. How Did Players Respond?

This is about engagement and learning, not just behaviour. Were players challenged or was it too easy? Were they making decisions or just following instructions? Did anyone have a visible "aha" moment? Did anyone switch off?

Be specific about individuals where you can. "Mia struggled with the 1v1 defending activity but improved once I changed the starting position" is useful. "Players were okay" is not.

### 3. What Would You Change?

If you ran the same session again next week, what would be different? A smaller area? Fewer players in the group? A clearer demonstration? More time on the game at the end?

This is the most actionable part of your reflection. It feeds directly into future planning. Many coaches keep repeating the same session design mistakes because they never write down what they would change.

### 4. How Were You as a Coach?

This is the uncomfortable one. How was your energy? Did you talk too much? Were your interventions well-timed or did you interrupt the flow? Did you coach all the players or just the ones who naturally draw your eye?

I used to talk far too much in sessions. Players would glaze over. I only broke that habit because I started writing it down after every session. Seeing "talked too long again" in my reflection three weeks running forced me to change.

### 5. What Carries Forward?

What from this session connects to the next one? Is there an activity you want to progress? A player who needs a conversation? A theme you want to continue? This bridges the gap between isolated sessions and a coherent coaching programme.

## How Long Should It Take?

Five minutes. Seriously. You do not need to write a match report. You need to capture the key observations while they are fresh and move on with your evening. If reflection feels like a burden, you are doing too much.

A good reflection might be 150 words. A great one might be 300. Anything beyond that and you are probably writing for the sake of writing rather than for the sake of learning.

The exception is when something significant happened. A player left upset. A drill created a genuine breakthrough moment. You lost your patience. Those sessions warrant more time, because the learning is richer.

## The Power of Reviewing

Here is where most coaches miss the real value of reflection. Individual reflections are useful, but the patterns that emerge across ten, twenty, fifty reflections are transformative.

You might notice that your sessions always run long because you spend too much time on the warm-up. Or that you mention the same three players every week and never write about the others. Or that your mood is consistently lower on Tuesdays, which correlates with poorer session quality.

These patterns are invisible in the moment. They only become visible when you have a body of structured data to look back on. This is where tools that track your reflections over time add genuine value. A notebook stores your thoughts. A reflection tool analyses them.

## Making It Stick

The biggest challenge with reflection is not doing it once. It is doing it fifty times. Here are three things that help.

**Attach it to an existing habit.** Reflect when you get in the car. Or when you sit down after putting the cones away. Or as part of your evening routine before you open your laptop. Habit stacking works because you are not creating a new behaviour from scratch.

**Keep it short.** The moment reflection starts feeling like work, you will stop. Five minutes. That is the contract. Some days you will write more because you have a lot to say. But the baseline is five minutes.

**Make it visible.** Track your streak. Seeing that you have reflected after every session for six weeks creates its own momentum. Breaking a streak feels worse than missing a single entry.

## Where Coach Reflection Fits

I built Coach Reflection because I wanted a system that made all of this easier. Guided prompts so you do not stare at a blank page. Voice notes so you can reflect from the car. AI that reads your reflections over time and surfaces the patterns you miss. Player tracking that works automatically from your natural writing.

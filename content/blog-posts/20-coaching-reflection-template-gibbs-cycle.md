# Free Coaching Reflection Template (Using the Gibbs Reflective Cycle)

Most coaches know they should reflect after sessions. Very few do it consistently. And of those who do, most default to the same unstructured approach: a vague mental replay on the drive home that evaporates before they reach the front door.

The problem is rarely motivation. It is structure. When you sit down (or stand in the car park) after a session and try to reflect, the question is: where do I start? What am I actually supposed to think about? How do I turn a jumble of impressions into something useful?

That is what a template solves. It gives you a starting point, a structure, and a finish line. You answer the questions, and the reflection is done. No staring at a blank page. No overthinking. Just honest answers to clear questions.

The template below is based on the Gibbs Reflective Cycle, which is the most widely used reflective model in coaching education. I have adapted the six stages into practical questions with example answers from real coaching scenarios. You can use it after training sessions, matches, or any coaching activity.

## Key Takeaways

- The Gibbs Reflective Cycle has six stages: Description, Feelings, Evaluation, Analysis, Conclusion, and Action Plan
- Each stage serves a specific purpose, and skipping stages (particularly Feelings and Analysis) reduces the quality of your reflection
- This template works for any sport, any level, and any type of session
- You do not need to write paragraphs. Brief, honest answers are more valuable than lengthy, polished ones
- The most important stage is the Action Plan, because that is where reflection becomes improvement
- Hot reviews (immediately after) capture details; cold reviews (next day) add perspective. Ideally, do both

## The Gibbs Reflective Cycle: A Quick Overview

Graham Gibbs published this model in 1988 as a framework for learning from experience. It has six stages that form a cycle, meaning the action plan from one reflection feeds into the description of the next.

The six stages are:

1. **Description** -- What happened?
2. **Feelings** -- What were you thinking and feeling?
3. **Evaluation** -- What was good and bad about the experience?
4. **Analysis** -- What sense can you make of the situation?
5. **Conclusion** -- What else could you have done?
6. **Action Plan** -- What will you do differently next time?

The cycle works because each stage builds on the previous one. Description sets the scene. Feelings add the human dimension. Evaluation starts the assessment. Analysis digs deeper. Conclusion synthesises the learning. And the Action Plan turns it all into something practical.

Most coaches, when they reflect informally, jump straight from Description to Conclusion. "The session was flat, so I need to make it more engaging next time." That skips the stages where the real learning happens: understanding why the session was flat, how you felt about it, and what specifically you could change.

## The Template

Copy this template. Use it after your next session. Write as much or as little as feels right for each stage. The prompts and examples below each question are there to guide you, not constrain you.

---

### Stage 1: Description

**What happened during the session?**

Stick to the facts. Describe the session as if you were explaining it to someone who was not there. Do not evaluate or judge yet. Just set the scene.

**Prompts to help:**
- What type of session was it? (training, match, tournament)
- What was the planned objective?
- What activities did you run?
- How many players attended? What was the age group?
- Did anything unexpected happen?

**Example answers:**

*Football:* "Under-12s training, Tuesday evening, 16 players. Objective was improving possession in tight spaces. Ran a warm-up with ball mastery, then a 4v4+2 rondo, then a 7v7 small-sided game with a condition of five passes before scoring. Session lasted 75 minutes."

*Rugby:* "Senior men's training, Thursday. 22 players. Focused on defensive alignment from set pieces. Ran a walk-through of defensive structure from lineout, then a live drill at game pace, then a 15-minute match scenario. Lost two players to a minor collision during the live drill."

*Basketball:* "Under-16 girls training, Saturday morning. 10 players (two absent). Worked on off-ball movement and screening. Used a 3v3 half-court game with constraints, then a 5v5 full-court scrimmage. Shorter session than planned because we lost court time."

---

### Stage 2: Feelings

**What were you thinking and feeling during the session?**

This is the stage coaches most often skip, and it is a mistake to skip it. Your emotional state directly affects your coaching decisions. If you were frustrated, your feedback changed. If you were excited, your energy shifted the room. Acknowledging your feelings is not soft. It is self-aware.

**Prompts to help:**
- How did you feel before the session started?
- Were there moments where your emotions changed?
- Did anything frustrate, surprise, or please you?
- How did you feel about your own performance as a coach?

**Example answers:**

*Football:* "I was confident going in because I had planned the session carefully. The rondo went well and I felt pleased. But when the small-sided game started, the five-pass condition made the game too slow and I got frustrated watching players just keep the ball without any intent. By the end I felt like the last twenty minutes were wasted."

*Rugby:* "I was anxious about the live drill because two of the younger players had never done full-contact defensive work at pace. When the collision happened, I felt responsible even though it was a fair contest. It took me a few minutes to refocus after checking they were okay."

*Basketball:* "Honestly, I was tired before I arrived. I had a long week and did not prepare as thoroughly as usual. During the session I noticed I was less patient than normal. When players were not executing the screens properly, I caught myself getting short with them, which is not how I want to coach."

---

### Stage 3: Evaluation

**What was good and bad about the experience?**

Now you start making judgements. What worked? What did not? Be specific. "It was fine" is not an evaluation.

**Prompts to help:**
- Which activities worked well? Why?
- Which activities did not work? Why?
- How did players respond?
- Were there specific moments that stood out (positively or negatively)?

**Example answers:**

*Football:* "Good: The rondo was excellent. The area was the right size, the overload worked, and players were competing hard for the ball. I could see real improvement in some players' first touch under pressure. Bad: The five-pass condition in the game killed the tempo. Players were more focused on counting passes than on finding attacking opportunities. The condition was too restrictive for this group."

*Rugby:* "Good: The walk-through was effective. Players clearly understood the defensive structure by the end of it, and several were coaching each other during the live drill. Bad: The transition from walk-through to live pace was too sudden. Some players were still in rehearsal mode when the drill went live, which contributed to the collision."

*Basketball:* "Good: The 3v3 half-court game was the best activity. The constraint of having to set a screen before every shot forced off-ball movement naturally. Bad: My coaching interventions were too frequent. I stopped the 5v5 scrimmage four times in ten minutes, which killed the flow and frustrated the players."

---

### Stage 4: Analysis

**What sense can you make of the situation?**

This is the deepest stage and the one that separates genuine reflection from surface-level thinking. You are looking for the why behind what happened. What caused the things you evaluated? What patterns do you notice? Can you connect this to anything you have learned or experienced before?

**Prompts to help:**
- Why did certain activities work and others not?
- What was the root cause of any problems?
- Is this part of a recurring pattern?
- What does this tell you about your coaching or your players?
- Can you connect this to anything you have learned from a course, a book, or another coach?

**Example answers:**

*Football:* "The rondo worked because it was a familiar format with clear rules and natural competition. Players knew what to do, so engagement was immediate. The five-pass condition failed because it was arbitrary. In a real game, you do not count passes. You make decisions based on what you see. I think the condition removed the decision-making element, which is exactly what I was trying to develop. I essentially designed the problem out of the activity."

*Rugby:* "The jump from walk-through to live pace is something I have struggled with before. I think I am either too cautious (staying in walk-through mode for too long) or too aggressive (going straight to full intensity). I need an intermediate step. Maybe a drill at 70% pace before going live. The collision was not caused by recklessness but by a player still operating at rehearsal speed being hit by one operating at game speed."

*Basketball:* "I stopped the scrimmage too often because I was trying to coach too many things at once. This happens when I have not prepared well. When my session plan is clear, I know exactly what I am looking for and I coach only that. When my preparation is weak, I try to coach everything I see, which overwhelms both me and the players."

---

### Stage 5: Conclusion

**What else could you have done?**

Consider alternatives. What options did you have that you did not take? What would you advise another coach in the same situation? This stage broadens your thinking beyond the specific session to general coaching principles.

**Prompts to help:**
- What alternative approaches were available?
- What would a more experienced coach have done?
- What have you learned about yourself from this session?
- What general principle can you take away?

**Example answers:**

*Football:* "Instead of a pass-count condition, I could have used a spatial condition: score from a different zone to where you received the ball. That would have encouraged possession with purpose rather than possession for its own sake. I could also have let the game run without conditions and coached the behaviour I wanted through questioning. The broader lesson is that conditions need to create the problem I want players to solve, not just add a rule for the sake of complexity."

*Rugby:* "I could have added a 'shadow' drill at moderate pace between the walk-through and the live drill. Players run through the defensive structure at 60-70% with passive attackers before going fully live. This gives them a chance to rehearse the movement at speed without the pressure of a contested situation. The principle I am taking away is that intensity transitions need to be graduated, not binary."

*Basketball:* "I could have chosen one coaching point for the entire scrimmage and let everything else go. Quality over quantity. The principle is clear: less preparation leads to more intervention, which leads to worse outcomes. My preparation is not a nice-to-have. It directly affects the quality of my coaching on the floor."

### Stage 6: Action Plan

**What will you do differently next time?**

This is the most important stage. Everything above is wasted if it does not lead to a specific, actionable change. Be concrete. Be specific. Give yourself something you can actually do in your next session.

**Prompts to help:**
- What one thing will you change?
- When will you try it?
- How will you know if it worked?

**Example answers:**

*Football:* "Next Tuesday, I will use the same 7v7 format but replace the five-pass condition with a zone-based condition. I will observe whether players show more intent to progress the ball forward while still maintaining possession. If engagement and tempo improve compared to this session, I will keep the approach."

*Rugby:* "Next session, I will add a 70% intensity rehearsal phase between the walk-through and the live drill. I will run it for five minutes with passive attackers before increasing to full intensity. I will watch for smoother transitions and fewer moments of players being caught at the wrong pace."

*Basketball:* "Before Saturday's session, I will spend fifteen minutes reviewing my plan and identifying one single coaching focus for the scrimmage. During the scrimmage, I will limit myself to a maximum of two stoppages. If I feel the urge to intervene more, I will make a note and address it after the activity."

## How to Use This Template

### Hot review (immediately after the session)

Complete Stages 1 and 2 within thirty minutes of the session ending. Description and Feelings are best captured while details and emotions are fresh. This can take as little as three minutes.

### Cold review (the following day)

Complete Stages 3 through 6 the next morning or whenever you have a few quiet minutes. Analysis, Conclusion, and Action Plan benefit from distance. You think more clearly about causes and alternatives when you are not still feeling the session.

### The quick version

If you do not have time for the full template, answer three questions:

1. What happened? (Stage 1)
2. Why? (Stage 4)
3. What will I change? (Stage 6)

This captures the essential learning in under three minutes.

## When NOT to Use the Full Gibbs Template

Gibbs is powerful, but it is not always necessary. There are times when a simpler approach serves you better.

**Routine sessions with no significant moments.** If the session went largely to plan and nothing stood out, a quick 3-question reflection is enough. Forcing yourself through all six stages when there is nothing substantial to analyse turns reflection into a chore.

**When you need speed over depth.** If you coach multiple sessions per day or per week, completing the full Gibbs cycle for every session is not sustainable. Save the full template for sessions where something significant happened, whether positive or negative.

**When you need a different lens.** Gibbs is focused on a specific experience. If you want to reflect on your development over a longer period, or on a theme across multiple sessions, other frameworks (like Kolb or a simple strengths-and-areas-for-growth review) may be more appropriate.

The point of a template is to help you, not to become another obligation. Use it when it adds value. Simplify when it does not.

## Adapting the Template for Different Sports

The examples above cover football, rugby, and basketball, but the template works for any sport. The questions are universal. Only the specifics change.

**Individual sports (athletics, swimming, tennis):** Focus Stage 1 on the individual athlete's performance and your coaching interactions. Stage 2 might explore your relationship with the athlete and how your feedback was received.

**Team sports (football, rugby, hockey, basketball):** Focus on both individual and group dynamics. Stage 4 (Analysis) often reveals the most when you consider team culture and group behaviour alongside technical and tactical elements.

**Strength and conditioning:** Focus Stage 1 on programme design and athlete response. Stage 4 might explore whether load progression, exercise selection, or recovery protocols need adjusting.

**Youth coaching:** Pay particular attention to Stage 2 (Feelings) and Stage 5 (Conclusion), as the emotional environment and inclusion of all participants are especially important at younger ages.

## From Template to Habit

A template is a tool, not a solution. The solution is the habit of reflecting consistently. The template just makes it easier to start.

In my experience, coaches who use a template for the first month or two eventually internalise the questions and no longer need the physical template. The structure becomes a natural way of thinking about sessions. But that internalisation only happens through repetition. You need the template until you do not.

Start with your next session. Answer the six questions. See what you learn about your coaching that you would not have noticed otherwise. Then do it again after the session after that.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long should each stage of the Gibbs reflection take?

There is no fixed time. For a routine session, you might spend thirty seconds on each stage, completing the whole cycle in three to four minutes. For a significant moment, you might spend five minutes on Analysis alone. Let the significance of the experience dictate the depth, not a timer.

### Do I need to write full paragraphs for each stage?

No. Bullet points, short sentences, and fragments are fine. The purpose is to capture your thinking, not to write an essay. Some of the most useful reflections I have seen are three or four bullet points per stage. Clarity matters more than length.

### Can I use Gibbs for match-day reflections as well as training?

Absolutely. The template works for any coaching experience: training sessions, matches, tournaments, one-to-one coaching conversations, even coaching courses you have attended. The questions adapt naturally because they are about the experience, not the format.

### What if I get stuck on the Analysis stage?

This is normal, especially when you are starting out. Analysis requires you to go beyond what happened and explore why. If you are stuck, try asking yourself: "Have I seen this before?" and "What would I tell another coach in this situation?" These questions often unlock the deeper thinking that Analysis requires.

### Is Gibbs better than other reflective models?

Not objectively. Gibbs is thorough and well-structured, which makes it good for detailed reflection. Driscoll's "What? So what? Now what?" model is simpler and faster. Kolb's cycle is more focused on learning through experimentation. The best model is the one you will use. Many coaches use Gibbs for significant moments and a simpler model for everyday sessions.

### How do I store my completed templates?

However you prefer. Paper journals, notes apps, voice memos, or a dedicated reflection tool. The key considerations are: can you search them later? Can you review them over time? And will you actually use the method consistently?

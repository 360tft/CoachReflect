## SLIDE 2 — THE PROBLEM

**Every coach reflects. Almost none of it gets captured.**

You think about your session in the car on the way home. What worked, what didn't, what you'd change. By the next morning, most of it is gone.

Reflective practice is a core part of every coaching qualification. But there's no tool built to support it.

Until now.

## SLIDE 3 — WHAT IS COACH REFLECTION?

**An AI-powered reflective journal built specifically for sports coaches.**

Log your sessions. Reflect with guided prompts that understand coaching context. Let AI surface patterns across weeks and months that you'd never spot yourself.

Voice or text. Takes 2-3 minutes after a session.

---

## SLIDE 4 — HOW IT WORKS

**Three steps. Two minutes. Done.**

**1. Log**
Record a voice note on the drive home, type a quick entry, or upload a photo of your session plan.

**2. Reflect**
AI asks targeted questions about your session. Not generic journaling prompts. Coaching-specific.

**3. Grow**
Over time, patterns and trends emerge. Blind spots get flagged. Your coaching development becomes visible.

---

## SLIDE 5 — KEY FEATURES

**Guided Reflection Prompts**
Built around coaching, not generic journaling. Questions about athletes, objectives, energy, decisions.

**Voice Note Capture**
Record your thoughts on the drive home. AI transcribes and structures them for you.

**Session Plan Upload**
Photograph your session plan. AI reads it and uses it to guide your reflection.

**Pattern Detection**
Across 10, 20, 50 sessions, the AI spots recurring themes you'd miss.

**Streak Tracking**
Build the reflection habit. Daily and weekly streaks with milestones.

**Web + Mobile**
Use it anywhere. iOS app coming soon.

## SLIDE 6 — THE AI DIFFERENCE

**This isn't a notes app.**

The AI understands coaching. It asks about athlete development, session flow, your decision-making, what you'd do differently.

It remembers your previous reflections. It learns your coaching style. After 30 sessions, it knows your patterns better than you do.

That's when the real value starts.

## SLIDE 10 — BUILT BY A COACH

**Kevin Middleton**
UEFA B Licensed Coach | 20+ years coaching experience

Founder of 360 TFT, the Football Coaching Academy (1,500+ coaches), and FootballGPT.

Coach Reflection wasn't built by a tech company guessing what coaches need. It was built by a coach who spent years reflecting in his head and wished he'd written it down.

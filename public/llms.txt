# CoachReflection

> Become a better coach after every session. AI-guided reflection for sports coaches.

CoachReflection is an AI-powered reflection tool that helps sports coaches capture, analyse, and learn from their coaching sessions. It provides guided post-session reflections using the Gibbs Reflective Cycle, identifies patterns over time, and supports continuing professional development. Most coaches forget 80% of what happened by the next day. CoachReflection fixes that with 2-minute guided reflections.

- Accepts session plan uploads with AI vision analysis (photograph handwritten plans)
- Supports voice note reflections for quick capture on the drive home
- Generates animated drill diagrams for 15+ sports
- Exports CPD records for continuing professional development
- Tracks mood, energy, and coaching trends across weeks and months
- AI remembers your coaching context and personalises advice
